# Subscription-page
I created a Subscription page using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Basic JavaScripts. HTML: Provides the structure of the webpage.  Tailwind CSS: Used for fast and responsive styling.  JavaScript (Optional): Can be added for interactivity like hover effects, dynamic content updates, or API calls.
